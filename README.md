The R script runanalysis.R is for the Data and Cleaning Data course.

It assumes setwd() has been set correctly for the right data directory

Run the script from R. It will get the data from the web, read it into
R, manipulate to be tidy, and the results end up in the data.frame 
"sub_act_data" (for subject-action-data).
