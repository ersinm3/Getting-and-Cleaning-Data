Experiments were carried out on 30 volunteers representd by numbers in
the "Subject" field. 
The experiments were run with subjects performing six activities
given in the "Activities" field. Activies are:
    WALKING
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    SITTING
    STANDING
    LAYING

For each subject/activity measurements were taken with a Samsung phone
using the accelerometer and gyros. The data in the tidy data file are
a conglomeration of measurements taken during training and testing.
Only the averaged (mean) and standard deviation (std) fields appear in the
file. Measurements are taken along three axes, represented by an "X", "Y"
or "Z" as the suffix of the field names. Field names prefixed with "time."
are time domain signals. Field names prefixed with "FFT." represent data
that wes transformed with a fast Fourier Transform. Field names beginning
with "angle." represent the angle measurements between two axes.
